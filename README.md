# BinarySearch
Binary Search Takes a sorted sequence of elements and figures out if a given element is within that sequence. In this project we will compare the middle number of our sequence to the item we're searching for. This determines if we continue looking right or left of the midpoint.

#The Binary Search Algorithim has a complexity of log2(n) because it doesn't matter how many elements are passes in the algorithm.
